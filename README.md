# Tradesatoshi-Framework
An public and private API wrapper for the Tradesatoshi Cryptocurrency exchange

The owner of the Tradesatoshi exchange asked me to program my Slingshot and Razer robots which trade cryptocurrencies on Cryptopia, for Tradesatoshi.  While I cannot supply code for the robots I design, I can freely give this Framework for anyone else who would like to develop a trading system for their platform

Enjoy
